Ahoy, me hearties. Here be your chance to conquer the seven seas, and show your fellow pirates who is the true Scourge. The risks will be plentiful, and the disappointments
big, but the rewards will be greater than you could ever imagine. Aye, this be the true test of wit, skill, and complete luck. This be, matey, the Pirate Game!

*The Battle*

The battle consists of 3 simple tasks even useless swaps can undertake, but only few swashbucklers can truly master:

1. Draw up your treasure map and join a pirate crew and ship
2. Collect precious gold coins whilst pillaging unsuspecting scallywags
3. Be the richest pirate to become the Scourge of the Seven Seas

*Task 1: Draw your Treasure Map*

In order to collect your booty-load of gold coins, you first need a treasure map to help guide you to the loot. This treasure map will mainly consist of amounts of gold for
you to accumulate as you travel the shores, but also contains many boobytraps to plunder your enemies for even greater bounties.
