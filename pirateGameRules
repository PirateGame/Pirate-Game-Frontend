Ahoy, me hearties. Here be your chance to conquer the seven seas, and show your fellow pirates who is the true Scourge. The risks will be plentiful, and the disappointments
big, but the rewards will be greater than you could ever imagine. Aye, this be the true test of wit, skill, and complete luck. This be, matey, the Pirate Game!

*The Battle*

The battle consists of 3 simple tasks even useless swaps can undertake, but only few swashbucklers can truly master:

1. Join a pirate crew and ship before drawing your treasure map
2. Collect precious gold coins whilst pillaging unsuspecting scallywags
3. Be the richest pirate to become the Scourge of the Seven Seas

*Task 1: Join a Pirate Crew and Ship*

Now in order to embark on your quest for the motherload, you will need to befriend a pirate crew, and board a ship together to sail the seas together. There will be three of
each that you will have to choose from, and they will play an important factor in what happens later in the game.

Your first choice will be which pirate crew you will join, out of the following three:

1. 
2. 
3. 

Once selecting this, you will then have to choose the pirate ship you will be embarking your quest on, out of the following three:

1. The Black Pearl
2. The Mermaid's Tale
3. 

*Task 2: Draw Your Treasure Map*

As well as your pirate ship and crew, you will also need a treasure map in order to find and collect a booty-load of gold coins. This treasure map will mainly consist of
amounts of gold for you to accumulate as you travel the shores, but also contains many booby traps to plunder your enemies for even greater bounties. Your treasure map will
contain the same set of treasures and booby traps as the other buccaneers undertaking this adventure with you, however they will all be unique, as it is up to you to decide
which squares in your grid will contain each type of space within the specific time limit at the start of the game.

For a recommended board size (7x7), you will have 5 minutes to produce your map consisting of the following spaces:

1x Booby Trap Pack (containing a Rob, Kill, Present, Skull and Crossbones, Swap, Choose Next Square, Shield, Mirror, Bomb, Double and Bank square)
1x 5000 gold coins
2x 3000 gold coins
10x 1000 gold coins
25x 200 gold coins

After you finish filling in your treasure map, check you're happy with it, as once you've submitted it, you cannot change it for the rest of the game. Once submitted, join
your crew on the ship both previously selected and set sail on your quest to conquer the seven seas!
